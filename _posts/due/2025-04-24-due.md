#### P3.6: Checkpoint 6
Post any feedback you have about the class on Canvas.. This could be things you wish we covered, are glad we covered, things you might adjust or change in the schedule or projects. Anything you think that might help make it a better class the next time it is offered.

#### P3: Final (Early)
Early deadline for your final video. Add it to the Vimeo group and upload it to the assignment on Canvas. If you are not completely done, still add what you have so we can watch it in class.
